The role of space in the measure of inequality is discussed, and a new theoretical model that relates inequality with economic growth is introduced. The proposed model extends a spatial Mankiw--Romer--Weil specification by introducing regional income inequality as a determinant of economic growth. The measure of inequality proposed as a covariate in the model is derived by a spatial decomposition of the Gini index. An empirical analysis focused on European Union NUTS-2 regions is carried out to illustrate the model.},

  abstract = {Traditional inequality measures fail to capture the geographical distribution of income. The failure to consider such distribution implies that, holding income constant, different spatial patterns provide the same inequality measure. This property is referred to as anonymity and presents an interesting question about the relationship between inequality and space. Particularly, spatial dependence could play an important role in shaping the geographical distribution of income and could be usefully incorporated into inequality measures. Following this idea, this paper introduces a new measure that facilitates the assessment of the relative contribution of spatial patterns to overall inequality. The proposed index is based on the Gini correlation measure and accounts for both inequality and spatial autocorrelation. Unlike most of the spatially based income inequality measures proposed in the literature, our index introduces regional importance weighting in the analysis, thereby differentiating the regional contributions to overall inequality. Starting with the proposed measure, a spatial decomposition of the Gini index of inequality for weighted data is also derived. This decomposition permits the identification of the actual extent of regional disparities and the understanding of the interdependences among regional economies. The proposed measure is illustrated by an empirical analysis focused on Italian provinces.},

When estimating regional inequality, many economists use inequality indices weighted by regions' proportion of the national population. Although this approach is widespread, its adequacy has not received attention in the regional science literature. This paper proves that such an approach is conceptually inconsistent, yielding an estimate of interpersonal inequality among the whole population of the country rather than an estimate of regional inequality. Nevertheless, as a measure of interpersonal inequality, such an estimate is very rough (even misleading) and does not always have an intuitive interpretation. Moreover, population-weighted inequality indices do not meet the requirements for an adequate measure of inequality.},

To this end, many attempts have been made to quantify the geography of opportunity and quite literally plot it on a map by combining evidence from studies on neighborhood effects with spatial data resources and geographic information systems (GIS) technology. Recently, these opportunity maps have not only become increasingly common but their preparation has been encouraged and facilitated by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. A closer look at the foundations and methods that underlie these exercises offers important lessons I examine the practice of opportunity mapping from both theoretical and methodological perspectives, highlighting several weaknesses of the common methods. Following this, I outline a theoretical framework based on Galster's categorization of the mechanisms of neighborhood effects. Using data from the Baltimore metropolitan region, I use confirmatory factor analysis to specify a measurement model that verifies the validity of the proposed theoretical framework. The model provides estimates of four latent variables conceived as the essential dimensions of spatial opportunity: socialinteractive, environmental, geographic, and institutional. Finally, I develop a neighborhood typology using unsupervised machine learning applied to the four dimensions of opportunity. Results suggest that opportunity mapping can be improved substantially through a better connection to the empirical literature on neighborhood effects, a multivariate statistical framework, and more direct relevance to public policy interventions.},

In this introduction to a special issue of Applied Geography, we set out to articulate the importance of urban spatial context in broader present-day inequality debates. We argue that the information-based economy is emphatically urban-based and that it has forged new spatial inequalities in and between cities and among urban populations. Income gaps have widened, inter-city disparities have grown, suburbs have been re-sorted into a wide array on the basis of class and race or ethnicity, and many central cities have assumed a renewed importance within metropolitan areas. We argue that attention to urban spatial dimensions at various scales is critical to understanding current inequality trends, from intra-urban to regional and global scales. Contributions to this special issue from North America, Europe, South America, and China suggest that deepening urban inequalities are pervasive across the globe.},

We apply classical and spatial Markov chains to measure spatial income dynamics and we employ a decomposition of spatial inequality to measure spatial polarization. In doing so, we ask the following questions: Has spatial inequality increased across Mexican municipios since 2000? What has been the role of place mobility in any changes in overall spatial inequality? Finally, we examine what the main components of place mobility have been over this period. We find evidence of a strong spatial dependency between municipios that has increased over time but we find no clear pattern at the state scale. Intra-state municipal inequality has relatively declined while Inter-state municipal inequality polarization has increased. We also find clear evidence that transitional dynamics of municipio incomes are influenced by spatial context. Substantial evidence shows that municipio income mobility is driven by a growth component that could be likely reflecting the devaluation of the peso over this period. Exchange mobility is found to be a more important component of overall place mobility than dispersion (inequality) mobility.},

The properties of the index are illustrated using several simple simulations and a case study of non-White--White segregation in Atlanta, Georgia.

It corresponds to the percentage of area below the 45{\textopenbullet} line that is between the 45{\textopenbullet} line and the Lorenz curve on a graph of cumulative income versus cumulative population. In this paper, new interpretations of the Gini coefficient are provided by disaggregating the Lorenz curve into a hierarchy of curves. These are based on hierarchical redistributions of income, where the population is first divided into ``high-income'' and ``low-income'' groups for purposes of the initial reallocation from the former group to the latter. Subsequent rounds further subdivide these groups and additional redistribution is carried out within them to remove remaining inequality. The Gini coefficient may be thought of as the expected percentage of total income that individuals will be involved with through this hierarchical redistribution process. A second, graphical interpretation showing the Gini coefficient as a weighted sum of the scaled Hoover indexes associated with a hierarchy of Lorenz curves is also provided. This latter interpretation allows for analyses that view inequality as an aggregate of inequalities that exist along different segments of the income distribution.},

  abstract = {Maternal health statistics have improved in many countries in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA). Still, progress remains slow in meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) targets. Accelerating antenatal care (ANC) coverage is critical to improving maternal health outcomes. To progress, countries should understand whether to target reducing health disparities between- or within-socioeconomic groups, as policies for achieving these may differ. This paper develops a framework for decomposing changes in socioeconomic inequalities in health into changes in between- and within-socioeconomic groups using the concentration index, a popular measure for assessing socioeconomic inequalities in health. It begins by noting the challenge in decomposing the concentration index into only between- and within-group components due to the possibility of an overlap created by overlapping distributions of socioeconomic status between groups. Using quantiles of socioeconomic status provides a convenient way to decompose the concentration index so that the overlap component disappears. In characterising the decomposition, a pro-poor shift occurs when socioeconomic inequality is reduced over time, including between- and within-socioeconomic groups, while a pro-rich shift or change occurs conversely. The framework is applied to data from two rounds of the Demographic and Health Survey of 19 countries in SSA conducted about ten years apart in each country. It assessed changes in socioeconomic inequalities in an indicator of at least four antenatal care visits (ANC4+) and the count of ANC visits (ANC intensity). The results show that many countries in SSA witnessed significant pro-poor shifts or reductions in socioeconomic inequalities in ANC coverage because pro-rich inequalities in ANC4+ and ANC intensity become less pro-rich. Changes in between-socioeconomic group inequalities drive the changes in ANC service coverage inequalities in all countries. Thus, policies addressing inequalities between-socioeconomic groups are vital to reducing overall disparities and closing the gap between the rich and the poor, a crucial objective for the SDGs.,                                        {$\bullet$}               Socioeconomic inequalities (SEI) in antenatal care (ANC) coverage are reducing in Africa.                                         {$\bullet$}               Changes in SEI are decomposable into between- and within-socioeconomic group components.                                         {$\bullet$}               The between-socioeconomic group component drives most of the changes in SEI in ANC coverage.                                         {$\bullet$}               Policies prioritising SEI between socioeconomic groups are needed to reduce overall SEI.},

The purpose of this note is to illustrate two different methods for decomposing the overall health concentration index using data collected from a Short Form (SF-36) survey of the general Australian population conducted in 1995. For simplicity, we focus on the physical functioning scale of the SF-36. Firstly we examine decomposition `by component' by separating the concentration index for the physical functioning scale into the ten items on which it is based. The results show that the items contribute differently to the overall inequality measure, i.e. two of the items contributed 13\% and 5\%, respectively, to the overall measure. Second, to illustrate the `by subgroup' method we decompose the concentration index by employment status. This involves separating the population into two groups: individuals currently in employment; and individuals not currently employed. We find that the inequality between these groups is about five times greater than the inequality within each group. These methods provide insights into the nature of inequality that can be used to inform policy design to reduce income related health inequalities.

This paper argues that Gini's Mean Difference (GMD), an alternative index of variability, shares many properties with the variance, but can be more informative about the properties of distributions that depart from normality. Its superiority over the variance is important whenever one is interested in one or more of the following properties: (a) stochastic dominance: the GMD can be used to form necessary conditions for stochastic dominance, while the variance cannot; (b) exchangeability: the GMD has two correlation coefficients associated with it, the difference between them being sensitive to the exchangeability between the marginal distributions. This property may play an important role whenever the ''index number'' problem is severe, (i.e., whenever the choice of the base for comparison between two marginal distributions may determine the direction of the results), or whenever the investigation procedure is based on an optimization procedure; (c) stratification: when the overall distribution is composed of sub-populations, the GMD is sensitive to stratification among subpopulations. The paper surveys the properties of the two indices of variability and discusses their relevance to several fields of research.},

The Gini Index of Spatial Segregation (GSS) is a ratio of two Gini indices that compares the inequality between neighbourhoods to the inequality between individuals at the macro-level where neighbourhoods are nested. Unlike earlier measures of segregation found in the literature, the GSS uses individualized neighbourhoods, which can be defined as an area constituted within a radius or as a population count method around an individual geo-location, depending on the population density and proximity among individuals in the study area. The GSS can measure residential segregation by any continuous variable for both radii and k-nearest neighbours (knn with and without a decay factor) approaches to bespoke neighbourhoods. Therefore, it is sensitive to the spatial configuration of the area, easy to compute and interpret, and suitable for comparative studies of segregation over time and across different contexts. An empirical application of the index is illustrated using data from Sweden that covers the entire population for 1994, 2004, and 2014. We demonstrate how the definition and scale of the neighbourhood influence the measures of economic segregation. Overall, the GSS offers a flexible and robust framework for measuring segregation that can be used to inform policy decisions and research on inequality.},

We determine when as a consequence of an income gain by an individual, an increase in the social stress measure dominates a concurrent increase in the aggregate income, such that the magnitude of the Gini coefficient increases. By integrating our approach to the construction of the Gini coefficient with Sen's social welfare function, we are able to endow the function with a social-psychological underpinning, showing that this function, too, is a composite of a measure of social stress and aggregate income. We reveal a dual role played by aggregate income as a booster of social welfare in Sen's social welfare function. Quite surprisingly, we find that a marginal increase of income for any individual, regardless of the position of the individual in the hierarchy of incomes, improves welfare as measured by Sen's social welfare function.},

  abstract = {Background: Over the last few decades, diabetes-related mortality risks (DRMR) have increased in Florida. Although there is evidence of geographic disparities in pre-diabetes and diabetes prevalence, little is known about disparities of DRMR in Florida. Understanding these disparities is important for guiding control programs and allocating health resources to communities most at need. Therefore, the objective of this study was to investigate geographic disparities and temporal changes of DRMR in Florida. Methods: Retrospective mortality data for deaths that occurred from 2010 to 2019 were obtained from the Florida Department of Health. Tenth International Classification of Disease codes E10--E14 were used to identify diabetes-related deaths. County-level mortality risks were computed and presented as number of deaths per 100,000 persons. Spatial Empirical Bayesian (SEB) smoothing was performed to adjust for spatial autocorrelation and the small number problem. High-risk spatial clusters of DRMR were identified using Tango's flexible spatial scan statistics. Geographic distribution and high-risk mortality clusters were displayed using ArcGIS, whereas seasonal patterns were visually represented in Excel. Results: A total of 54,684 deaths were reported during the study period. There was an increasing temporal trend as well as seasonal patterns in diabetes mortality risks with high risks occurring during the winter. The highest mortality risk (8.1 per 100,000 persons) was recorded during the winter of 2018, while the lowest (6.1 per 100,000 persons) was in the fall of 2010. County-level SEB smoothed mortality risks varied by geographic location, ranging from 12.6 to 81.1 deaths per 100,000 persons. Counties in the northern and central parts of the state tended to have high mortality risks, whereas southern counties consistently showed low mortality risks. Similar to the geographic distribution of DRMR, significant high-risk spatial clusters were also identified in the central and northern parts of Florida. Conclusion: Geographic disparities of DRMR exist in Florida, with high-risk spatial clusters being observed in rural central and northern areas of the state. There is also evidence of both increasing temporal trends and Winter peaks of DRMR. These findings are helpful for guiding allocation of resources to control the disease, reduce disparities, and improve population health.},

  abstract = {Social scientists and policymakers alike have become increasingly concerned with understanding the nature, causes, and consequences of inter-regional inequality in economic living conditions. Contemporary spatial inequality is multi-faceted---it varies depending on how we define inequality, the scale at which it is measured, and which groups in the labor force are considered. Increasing economic inequality has important implications for broader social and political issues. Notably, it is difficult to account for the rise of far-right populism in industrialized countries without considering the context of growing inter-regional inequality. Important explanations for the rise in inter-regional inequality include changing patterns of worker and firm sorting processes across space, major transitions like the reorientation of the economy from manufacturing to digital technologies, and increasing global economic integration, as well as policy. Different causal explanations in turn imply a different role for place-based policy. This article introduces the context of the special issue on the nature, causes, and consequences of inter-regional inequality, focusing specifically on inequality in North America and Western Europe, and aims to identify challenges for, and spark further research on, inter-regional inequality.},

Yet, today's spatial inequality, and how it relates to the past, remains insufficiently well understood. The primary contribution of this article is to demonstrate a deep polarization in the American spatial system---yet one whose character differs from that commonly reported on in the literature. The increase in spatial inequality since 1980 is almost entirely driven by a small number of populous, economically important, and resiliently high-income superstar city-regions. But we also show that the rest of the system exhibits a long-run pattern of income convergence over the study period. A secondary contribution is historical: today's superstars have sat durably atop the urban hierarchy since at least 1940. Third, we describe six distinctive pathways of development that regions follow between 1940 and 2019, with certain locations catching up, falling behind, and surging ahead. We explore the role played by initial endowments in driving locations down these pathways, finding population, education, industrial structure, and immigrant attraction to be key distinguishing features. These insights are enabled by a fourth contribution: methodologically, we use group-based trajectory modeling---an approach new to the field that integrates top-down and bottom-up views of the evolving national spatial system. We conclude by exploring implications for the mid-twenty-first century.},

  abstract = {Poorer citizens are often more exposed to environmental hazards due to spatial inequalities in the distribution of urban blue-green space. Few cities have managed to prevent spatial and social inequality despite sustainable development strategies like compact city planning. We explore whether environmental injustice exists in a city where one would least expect to find it: a city with abundant nature, an affluent population governed by a left leaning social democratic city council, and an aggressive densification strategy; Oslo, Norway. Green space was measured with a satellite-derived vegetation index which captures the combined availability of gardens, street trees, parks and forest. Blue space was defined by the proximity of residential areas to the closest lake, river or fjord. We found that poorer city districts, often with greater immigrant populations, have less available blue-green spaces and are disproportionately exposed to hazardous air pollution levels, but not extreme heat compared to wealthier city districts. Citizens living within 100 m of a water body are likely to earn US\$ 20,000 more per year than citizens living 500 m away from water, and a US\$ 3000 increase in annual income corresponds to a 10 \% increase in green space availability. Hazardous air pollution concentrations in the poorest city districts were above levels recommended by the WHO and Oslo municipality. Historical trends showed that districts undergoing population densification coincide with the lowest availability of blue-green space, suggesting that environmental justice has been overlooked in compact city planning policy. Despite Oslo's affluence and egalitarian ideals, the patterns of inequality we observed mirror the city's historical east-west class divide and point to spatial concentration of wealth as a core factor to consider in studies of green segregation. Urban greening initiatives in Oslo and other cities should not take spatial equality for granted, and instead consider socio-economic geographies in their planning process.},

  abstract = {Since 1989, inequality in Mexico has risen, declined, and risen again. The evolution of labour income inequality is at the core of this pattern. To reverse the current trend of rising inequality, access to secondary and tertiary education should continue to expand, minimum wages should be increased, and the tax and cash transfer system rethought. Between 1989--94, inequality increased in Mexico; between 1994--2006, inequality declined; and between 2006--14, inequality was again on the rise The key factor that explains this `rise-decline-rise' pattern was the evolution of labour income inequality The reduction in direct transfers combined with the expansion of indirect taxes led to a continuous reduction in the amount of cash benefits that reached the extreme poor during 2012--16 Mexico is an upper-middle-income country with a Gini coefficient hovering around 0.5 which places it among the high inequality countries. Since the mid-1980s, Mexico has become more open to international trade and undergone changes in production technology. In addition, its labour force became considerably more educated: the proportion of individuals with primary education or less declined from 67\% in 1990 to 33\% in 2015, and the share of individuals with a college education more than doubled between 1990--2015 when it reached around 15\%. The last thirty years were also marked by a significant increase in social spending and a retooling of social programmes. Rise-decline-rise again pattern The evolution of income inequality during the period 1989--2004 can be summarized as follows: between 1989--94, inequality increased; between 1994--2006, inequality declined; and between 2006--14, inequality was again on the rise. The key component that underlies the `rise-decline-rise' pattern was the evolution of labour income inequality. Changes in labour income inequality were primarily influenced by the skill-premium. During 1989--94, driven by both market forces (increasing demand for skills) and institutional factors (decline in the real minimum wage and unionization rate) the skill-premium rose. During the period of declining labour income inequality (1994--2006), the skill-premium declined. The increase in supply of workers with at least a high-school diploma appears to have driven the decline in returns to higher skills. During 2006--14, inequality appeared to be on the rise again. While the incomes of all workers fell as a consequence of the Great Recession, the returns to low-skilled workers fell more pronouncedly. Demand for workers with low skills appears to have suffered disproportionately during the years of negative or low growth. Given the patterns observed in the dynamics of labour income inequality, two key policy implications emerge. First, continuing the expansion of access to higher education (post-secondary and tertiary) is key, as is ensuring that the education is of reasonable quality. Second, minimum wages should be increased to the levels prior to their decline in the 1980s. Cash transfers to the poor in decline Direct cash transfers in Mexico are largely targeted to the poor. However, despite the expansion of targeted programmes since the second half of the 1990s, their effect remains limited because of their small scale. Moreover, the redistributive effect has declined significantly since 2010 as transfers have become less progressive and indirect taxes have increased. The modest redistributive impact of Mexico's fiscal system is due to a minimal allocation of resources to cash transfers that benefit the poor. Even at their peak (2014), these transfers represented just 0.8\% of GDP, with just 0.35\% of GDP going to the poorest quintile (which roughly corresponds to the extreme poor). More importantly, the expansion of indirect taxes and indirect subsidies and recent reduction of direct transfers has meant a continuous reduction in net cash benefits reaching the extreme poor, from 0.38\% of GDP in 2012 to 0.19\% in 2016. The reduction of transfers reaching the extremely poor after 2012 has thus completely reversed the expansion of these benefits that were achieved over the previous decade (2002--12). The increase in indirect taxes would have been an effective basis for a powerful redistributive reform of the fiscal system had it been used to finance a significant increase in transfers targeted to the poor. Instead, it was used to substitute declining oil revenues and to finance the expansion of regressive contributory pension subsidies. Time for more universal cash transfers? Given the coverage that Mexico's flagship conditional cash transfer programme has already achieved (6 million households, or a fifth of the population), and the possible economic disincentives that a significant expansion in the level of transfers per beneficiary might entail, a major expansion while preserving its current targeting and effectiveness may be difficult to achieve. In addition, some results indicate that the errors of exclusion---that is, poor individuals who do not receive the Prospera cash transfer---are rather significant. Perhaps the time has come to consider more universal transfers. If all the resources devoted to non-progressive transfers could be reallocated to a universal basic income scheme, this reform would be highly progressive. Of course, the inequality- and poverty-reducing effect of these resources would be higher if they were allocated to the poorer segments of the population but targeting mechanisms appear to have run their course. However, the political resistance to a pro-poor reallocation of the transfers that currently also benefit the non-poor could prove insurmountable. An alternative and bolder policy scenario would be to finance the universal basic income through new taxes. The fiscal cost of a basic income that equalled the current poverty gap would be 2.87\% of GDP. Continuing the expansion of access to higher education---including tertiary education---is key, as is ensuring that education is of reasonable quality Minimum wages should be increased to the levels prior to their decline in the 1980s A highly progressive reform would be to reallocate all the resources devoted to non-progressive transfers to programmes targeted to the poor (such as the now defunct Prospera), or to raise personal income taxes from the richest and implement a universal basic income equal to the average poverty gap To make this change budget-neutral, the incidence of direct personal income taxes for the top 10\% would have to rise from roughly 8\% to 13\%; an order of magnitude which seems reasonable given the enormous concentration of income and wealth at the top and the relatively low burden of direct personal and wealth taxes for the richest group.},

The welfare loss of taxation is decomposed into three components, one being a generalised Kakwani index, which accommodates the intermediate inequality views. We show that for a progressive (regressive) tax, moving closer to the relative view reduces (increases) the importance of progressivity (regressivity) for the welfare impact of the tax. The perception of the importance of progressivity and regressivity is thus affected by the inequality view taken. The empirical application considers the welfare loss of taxation in Croatia.},

  abstract = {A variety of factors are associated with greater COVID-19 morbidity or mortality, due to how these factors influence exposure to (in the case of morbidity) or severity of (in the case of mortality) COVID-19 infections. We use multiscale geographically weighted regression to study spatial variation in the factors associated with COVID-19 morbidity and mortality rates at the local authority level across England (UK). We investigate the period between March 2020 and March 2021, prior to the rollout of the COVID-19 vaccination program. We consider a variety of factors including demographic (e.g. age, gender, and ethnicity), health (e.g. rates of smoking, obesity, and diabetes), social (e.g. Index of Multiple Deprivation), and economic (e.g. the Gini coefficient and economic complexity index) factors that have previously been found to impact COVID-19 morbidity and mortality. The Index of Multiple Deprivation has a significant impact on COVID-19 cases and deaths in all local authorities, although the effect is the strongest in the south of England. Higher proportions of ethnic minorities are associated with higher levels of COVID-19 mortality, with the strongest effect being found in the west of England. There is again a similar pattern in terms of cases, but strongest in the north of the country. Other factors including age and gender are also found to have significant effects on COVID-19 morbidity and mortality, with differential spatial effects across the country. The results provide insights into how national and local policymakers can take account of localized factors to address spatial health inequalities and address future infectious disease pandemics., {$\bullet$}The drivers of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality vary across England, UK.{$\bullet$}Index of Multiple Deprivation had a significant effect on local COVID-19 deaths.{$\bullet$}Areas with larger ethnic minority populations had higher COVID-19 cases and deaths.{$\bullet$}The effect of both gender and age vary across the country.{$\bullet$}Rates of smoking, obesity and diabetes are less significant at the local level.},

As a tool for promoting gender equity, it has gained increasing traction in popular media, international aid strategies, and global agenda-setting4--6. The global health agenda is increasingly focused on evidence of precision public health, which illustrates the subnational distribution of disease and illness7,8; however, an agenda focused on future equity must integrate comparable evidence on the distribution of social determinants of health9--11. Here we expand on the available precision SDG evidence by estimating the subnational distribution of educational attainment, including the proportions of individuals who have completed key levels of schooling, across all low- and middle-income countries from 2000 to 2017. Previous analyses have focused on geographical disparities in average attainment across Africa or for specific countries, but---to our knowledge---no analysis has examined the subnational proportions of individuals who completed specific levels of education across all low- and middle-income countries12--14. By geolocating subnational data for more than 184~million person-years across 528 data sources, we precisely identify inequalities across geography as well as within populations.},

  abstract = {Wealth inequality has been sharply rising in the United States and across many other high-income countries. Due to a lack of data, we know little about how this trend has unfolded across locations within countries. Examining the subnational geography of wealth is crucial because, from one generation to the next, it shapes the distribution of opportunity, disadvantage, and power across individuals and communities. By employing machine-learning-based imputation to link national historical surveys conducted by the U.S. Federal Reserve to population survey microdata, the data presented in this article addresses this gap. The Geographic Wealth Inequality Database (``GEOWEALTH-US'') provides the first estimates of the level and distribution of wealth at various geographical scales within the United States from 1960 to 2020. The GEOWEALTH-US database enables new lines of investigation into the contribution of spatial wealth disparities to major societal challenges including wealth concentration, income inequality, social mobility, housing unaffordability, and political polarization.},

Here we reinforce the idea that reality is far from this lofty ideal. We document the extent and nature of inequities in voter participation in the United States with a level of granularity and precision that previous research has not afforded. To do so, we use a unique nationwide dataset of approximately 400 million validated voting records across multiple election cycles. With this novel dataset, we document large and persistent gaps in voter turnout by race, age, and political affiliation. Minority citizens, young people, and those who support the Democratic Party are much less likely to vote than whites, older citizens, and Republican Party supporters. Minorities, youth, and democrats are also much more likely to live in local communities where fewer individuals vote---areas that we term turnout deserts. Turnout deserts are especially pernicious given that they are self-reinforcing---bolstered by the social dynamics that fundamentally shape citizens' voting patterns. Our results show just how glaring inequities in political participation are in the US. These patterns threaten the very fabric of our democracy and fundamentally shift the balance of political power in the halls of government towards the interests of whites, older citizens, and republicans. They illustrate that participation in the United States is strikingly unequal---far from the ideals that this country has long aspired to.},

  abstract = {To simultaneously overcome the limitation of the Gini index in that it is less sensitive to inequality at the tails of income distribution and the limitation of the inter-decile ratios that ignore inequality in the middle of income distribution, an inequality index is introduced. It comprises three indicators, namely, the Gini index, the income share held by the top 10\%, and the income share held by the bottom 10\%. The data from the World Bank database and the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development Income Distribution Database between 2005 and 2015 are used to demonstrate how the inequality index works. The results show that it can distinguish income inequality among countries that share the same Gini index but have different income gaps between the top 10\% and the bottom 10\%. It could also distinguish income inequality among countries that have the same ratio of income share held by the top 10\% to income share held by the bottom 10\% but differ in the values of the Gini index. In addition, the inequality index could capture the dynamics where the Gini index of a country is stable over time but the ratio of income share of the top 10\% to income share of the bottom 10\% is increasing. Furthermore, the inequality index could be applied to other scientific disciplines as a measure of statistical heterogeneity and for size distributions of any non-negative quantities.},

Specifically, we propose a measure that evaluates observed between-group inequality against a benchmark of maximum between-group inequality that can be attained when the number and relative sizes of groups under examination are fixed. We argue that such a modification can provide a complementary perspective on the question of whether a particular population breakdown is salient to an assessment of inequality in a country. As our measure normalizes between-group inequality by the number and relative sizes of groups, it is also less subject to problems of comparability across different settings. We show that for a large set of countries our assessment of the importance of group differences typically increases substantially on the basis of this approach. The ranking of countries (or different population groups) can also differ from that obtained using traditional decomposition methods. Finally, we observe an interesting pattern of higher levels of overall inequality in countries where our measure finds higher between-group contributions.},

Atkinson'sinequality index is given an interpretation of mean order \# and then it is decomposed for population subgroups. Various other measures are considered for decompositions and a variety of decomposition schemes for Gini coefficient and other measures in the literature is reviewed and commented upon. Empirical analysis using U.S.A. and U.K. data are performed on the basis of income distribution data classified by family size. For various decomposition schemes, contribution to between sEe-group and within size-groupinequalities are compared in percentage terms. Comparisons are also made over time for the years 1964 and 1974 both for U.S.A. and U.K. and the result indicates that within size-group income inequality has declined while between size group and total income inequality shows an increase. Three important properties of Atkinson'sinequality index are proved in the appendix.},

  abstract = {This paper considers a partitioned population and develops a decomposition of the Gini index in two components, which measure the within and the between groups inequality. Differently from the most widespread inequality measure decompositions, having a between component that compares the means of the groups, ours informs about the distance between their entire distributions. This makes the decomposition helpful in several frameworks, such as in the measurement of spatial concentration A Monte Carlo experiment supports the appropriateness of our components highlighting that they strongly correlate with two axiomatically derived benchmarks. The presentation of a case study concerning the income distribution in the Italian provinces concludes the work and stresses the informativeness of the proposed decomposition.},
